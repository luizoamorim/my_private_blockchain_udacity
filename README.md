# Project Introduction

This project demonstrate the fundamental concepts of a Blockchain platform. 
Concepts like:

```
- Block
- Blockchain
- Wallet
- Blockchain Identity
- Proof of Existence
- Digital Assets
```

In this project I will use a REST Api expose some of the functionalities 
that I'll implement in the private blockchain.

# Problem description
Your employer is trying to make a proof of concept on how a Blockchain 
application can be implemented in his company.

He is an astronomy fan and because of that he spends most of his free time 
searching stars in the sky, that's why he wants to create a test application 
that allows him and his friends to register stars, and track the ownership of 
each.

# What steps are needed to implement your employers application?
1. The application will create a Genesis Block when we run the application.
2. The user will request the application to send a message to be signed using 
a Wallet and in this way verify the ownership over the wallet address. 
The message format will be:
```
<WALLET_ADRESS>:${new Date().getTime().toString().slice(0,-3)}:starRegistry
```
3. Once the user has the message they can use a Wallet (Electrum or Bitcoin 
Core for example) to sign the message.
4. The user will try to submit the Star object for that. The submission will 
consist of: **wallet address**, **message**, **signature** and the 
**star object** with the star information. The Start information will be 
formed in this format:
```
"star": {
    "dec": "68Â° 52' 56.9",
    "ra": "16h 29m 1.0s",
    "story": "Testing the story 4"
}
```
5. The application will verify if the time elapsed from the request ownership 
(the time is contained in the message) and the time when you submit the star is
 less than 5 minutes.
6. If everything is okay the star information will be stored in the block and 
added to the chain encoding the Star information.
7. The application will allow us to retrieve the Star objects belong to an 
owner (wallet address). This information should be human readable so it 
shouldn't be encoded.

# Tools or technologies 
This application will be created using Node.js and Javascript programming 
language. The architecture will use ES6 classes because it will help us to 
organize the code and facilitate the maintenance of the code.

Some of the libraries or npm modules you will use are:
```
- "bitcoinjs-lib": "^4.0.3",
- "bitcoinjs-message": "^2.0.0",
- "body-parser": "^1.18.3",
- "crypto-js": "^3.1.9-1",
- "express": "^4.16.4",
- "hex2ascii": "0.0.3",
- "morgan": "^1.9.1"
```
